Tachyon is built with some strong opinions and assumptions:

- Runs on AWS (using CloudFront, Lambda and API Gateway.)
- Expects original image files to be stored on Amazon S3.
- Only supports simple image resizing, not a full image manipulation service.

Tachyon works best with WordPress, coupled with [S3 Uploads](github.com/humanmade/s3-uploads) and the [Tachyon Plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/tachyon-plugin).

## Installing

Tachyon is simple to install, just use the `cloudformation-template.json` in this repository to create the whole stack using AWS CloudFormation. It will ask you for a few details along the way.

You'll need to upload the latest release to Amazon S3 and put the location in the to the CloudFormation stack configuration.

## Using

Tachyon provides a simple HTTP interface in the form of:

`https://{tachyon-domain}/my/image/path/on/s3.png?w=100&h=80`

It's really that simple!

#### Args Reference

| URL Arg | Type | Description |
|---|----|---|
|`w`|Number|Max width of the image.|
|`h`|Number|Max height of the image.|
|`resize`|String, "w,h"|Resize and crop an image to exact width,height pixel dimensions.|
|`quality`|Number, 0-100|Image quality.|
|`crop`|String, "x,y,w,h"|Crop an image by percentages x-offset,y-offset,width,height (x,y,w,h). Percentages are used so that you donâ€™t need to recalculate the cropping when transforming the image in other ways such as resizing it. `crop=160px,160px,788px,788px` takes a 788 by 788 square starting at 160 by 160.|
|`webp`|Boolean, 1|Force WebP format.|
|`lb`|String, "w,h"|Add letterboxing effect to images, by scaling them to width, height while maintaining the aspect ratio and filling the rest with black or `background`.|
|`background`|String|Add background color via name (red) or hex value (%23ff0000). Don't forget to escape # as `%23`.|

Created by Human Made for high volume and large-scale sites, such as [Happytables](http://happytables.com/). We run Tachyon on sites with millions of monthly page views, and thousands of sites.

Written and maintained by [Joe Hoyle](https://github.com/joehoyle).

Tachyon is inspired by Photon by Automattic. As Tachyon is not an all-purpose image resizer, rather it uses a media library in Amazon S3, it has a different use case to [Photon](https://jetpack.com/support/photon/).

Tachyon uses the [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) (Used under the license Apache License 2.0) Node.js library for the resizing operations, which in turn uses the great libvips library.
